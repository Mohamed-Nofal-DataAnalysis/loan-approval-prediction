## 📊 Dataset

- **614** loan applications from a financial institution
- **13** features including applicant demographics, income, loan amount, and credit history
- **Target variable:** `Loan_Status` → Y (Approved) = 68.7% | N (Rejected) = 31.3%

### Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Gender` | Applicant gender |
| `Married` | Marital status |
| `Dependents` | Number of dependents |
| `Education` | Graduate / Not Graduate |
| `Self_Employed` | Self-employment status |
| `ApplicantIncome` | Applicant monthly income |
| `CoapplicantIncome` | Co-applicant monthly income |
| `LoanAmount` | Loan amount requested (K) |
| `Loan_Amount_Term` | Term of loan in months |
| `Credit_History` | Credit history (1 = Good, 0 = Bad) |
| `Property_Area` | Urban / Semiurban / Rural |
| `Loan_Status` | Target — Y (Approved) / N (Rejected) |

## 🔄 Project Pipeline

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Loaded dataset — 614 rows × 13 columns
- Analyzed distributions of income, loan amount, and term
- Visualized approval patterns across education, marital status, gender, and property area
- Identified missing values across 6 columns

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- **Categorical columns** → filled with Mode (Gender, Married, Dependents, Self_Employed, Credit_History, Loan_Amount_Term)
- **LoanAmount** → filled with Median to avoid skew sensitivity
- Confirmed **0 duplicate records**
- Replaced `'3+'` dependents with `4` for numerical encoding
- Saved cleaned dataset as `loan_cleaned.csv`

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Label Encoding applied to all categorical variables:
  - `Gender`: Male=1, Female=0
  - `Married`: Yes=1, No=0
  - `Self_Employed`: Yes=1, No=0
  - `Property_Area`: Rural=0, Semiurban=1, Urban=2
  - `Education`: Graduate=1, Not Graduate=0
  - `Loan_Status`: Y=1, N=0

### 4. Model Training & Evaluation

- **Train/Test Split:** 90% / 10% with stratification (552 train | 62 test)
- **Primary Model:** Support Vector Machine — Linear Kernel

| Model | Test Accuracy |
|-------|:-------------:|
| **Logistic Regression** | **80.6%** |
| **SVM — Linear ✅** | **80.6%** |
| Naive Bayes | 80.6% |
| Random Forest | 77.4% |
| Gradient Boosting | 75.8% |
| KNN | 72.6% |

### 5. Power BI Dashboard
- **KPI Cards:** Total Requests, Approval Rate, Avg Loan Amount, Median Income, Good Credit Ratio
- **Charts:** Approval by Education & Marital Status, Dependents Impact, Property Area Analysis, Gender Distribution, Loan Status Breakdown
- **6 Interactive Slicers** for full data exploration

## 💡 Key Insights

- 💳 **Credit History is the #1 driver** — 85.5% of good-credit applicants were approved
- 🎓 **Education matters** — Graduates had 70.8% approval vs significantly lower for non-graduates
- 🏘️ **Semiurban leads** — highest demand (233 applications) AND best approval rates
- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Dependents impact** — approval peaks at 1–2 dependents, drops at 3+
- ⚖️ **No gender bias detected** — Female 50.79% vs Male 49.21%, nearly equal distribution
- 💍 **Married applicants** show 71.8% approval rate
